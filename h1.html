       <p>Cricket is a religion in India. People go insane when any national or international cricket event is organized in India or telecasted. We all complete our work and then get ready to stick to the television to enjoy every second of an important match. The long-lasting debates of the fans can be witnessed in public places. The huge popularity that our country’s cricket team got is because of an excellent captain named Mahendra Singh Dhoni. This essay on Dhoni will tell us how a simple boy from Jharkhand got the chance to captain India’s cricket team, the most formidable team in the world.</p>

        
        <p>Dhoni was born on 7th July 1981. His parents are Pan Singh and Devaki Dev. They stayed in Ranchi (Jharkhand). He has two siblings. His father was a junior manager in Mecon. Dhoni showed immense interest in playing football and badminton. Even at the school level, he excelled in both the sports and was selected for the district-level competitions. He studied at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir School located in Ranchi. He was an excellent goalkeeper. Watching his eye-catchy skills, his football coach sent him to a local cricket club to play cricket.</p>
        
        
        <p>He never played cricket before but he managed to grab the concept perfectly. His wicket-keeping skills amazed everyone in the club. He was appointed as the wicketkeeper for the local team on a regular basis. Later, he started to focus primarily on cricket and left his glory days of football and badminton behind. It was a drastic change in his life. He started to take professional coaching after Class X. He was also a meritorious student and teachers respected him for his versatile nature. He used to manage his studies and sports sessions perfectly. His family was very supportive of his ambitions.</p>
